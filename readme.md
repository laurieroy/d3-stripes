# WARMING STRIPES	1880-2021
This is a data visualization project based off of [Ed Hawkins](https://twitter.com/ed_hawkins)' original presentation. My goal is to learn some [D3](https://d3js.org). I'm following a tutorial from v5.

Data is from [NASA's](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/) Combined Land-Surface Air and Sea-Surface Water Temperature Anomalies (Land-Ocean Temperature Index, L-OTI), with the  base period: 1951-1980. That is, these monthly deviations are from the corresponding 1951-1980 means. (sources:  GHCN-v4 1880-12/2021 + SST: ERSST v5 1880-12/2021
                    using elimination of outliers and homogeneity adjustment)
